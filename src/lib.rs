//! A Rust implementation of DogStatsD server & client.

//! The statsd protocol consistents of plain-text single-packet messages sent

//! Due to the inherent design of the system, there is no guarantee that metrics
//! will be received by the server, and there is (by design) no indication of
//! this.
